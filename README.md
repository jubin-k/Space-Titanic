# Spaceship-Titanic
##### The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.

##### While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!
##### To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, you are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.
 Training and testing dataset are sperately given.
 Exploratory data analysis is done to understand the relationship between the inputs and the output.
 Graphs are plotted using seaborn and matplotlib.
 ML model is created using KNN model using k value with least error and the output is predicted with an acuuracy of 76.75%
